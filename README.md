# Machine_Learning_Specialization

The repository contains a collection of notes and solutions to the specialization about which broad information is given below:

This module consisting of 3 courses, namely below, is a foundational program created with collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. It is taught by Andrew Ng, researcher at Stanford University with groundbreaking work at Google Brain, Baiudi, and Landing.AI to advance the AI field.

1. [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://github.com/AkbarBunyad/Machine_Learning_Specialization/tree/main/ML_Spec_by_Andrew_Ng/1)
2. [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/AkbarBunyad/Machine_Learning_Specialization/tree/main/ML_Spec_by_Andrew_Ng/2)
3. [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/AkbarBunyad/Machine_Learning_Specialization/tree/main/ML_Spec_by_Andrew_Ng/3)


It provides a broad introduction to modern machine learning, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of the best practices used in Silicon Valley for artificial intelligence and machine learning innovation (evaluating and tuning models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, and more.)
